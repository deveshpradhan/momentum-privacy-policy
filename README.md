# Privacy Policy for Momentum App

**Effective Date:** October 15, 2025

Momentum ("the App") is committed to protecting user privacy and ensuring transparency in how data is handled. This policy outlines the types of information collected, the purpose of collection, and the safeguards in place.

---

## 1. Information We Collect

Momentum does not collect personal data automatically or in the background. However, certain user-initiated actions may result in data being transmitted and stored:

- **Location Data**: When a user submits a visit form, their current location is sent to our backend and stored for organizational tracking purposes.
- **Dealer Contact Information**: Users may manually enter dealer phone numbers during visits. These numbers are stored and used solely by the user's organization for operational purposes.
- **Device Information (Help Feature)**: When a user taps the Help button, their local email client is launched with a pre-filled message containing device model, OS version, and app version. This information is not collected or stored by the appâ€”it is only shared if the user chooses to send the email.

---

## 2. Use of Firebase SDKs

Momentum includes Firebase SDKs for build distribution and infrastructure support. While Firebase Analytics is present in the app build, it is explicitly disabled at runtime. No behavioral data, usage statistics, or device identifiers are collected or transmitted via Firebase Analytics.

## 3. How We Use Data

- Submitted data is stored securely and used exclusively by the user's organization for internal tracking and workflow optimization.
- No data is shared with third parties.
- We do not use advertising, profiling, or background data collection mechanisms.

---

## 4. Data Security

- All data transmitted is encrypted in transit using industry-standard protocols.
- Data is stored securely and accessed only by authorized personnel within the user's organization.

## 5. User Rights

Users may request deletion of submitted data or raise privacy concerns by contacting us at:
