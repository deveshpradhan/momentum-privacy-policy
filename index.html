  <h1>Privacy Policy for BizCon</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> December 31, 2025</p>
  <p><strong>Version:</strong> 2.0</p>
  <p>BizCon ("the App") is developed and maintained by MomentumSoft ("the Company"). We are committed to protecting user privacy and ensuring transparency in how data is handled. This policy outlines the types of information collected, the purpose of collection, and the safeguards in place.</p>
  <hr>
  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Location Data:</strong> When a user submits a visit form, their current location is sent to our backend and stored for organizational tracking purposes.</li>
    <li><strong>Camera and Photos:</strong> The app requests access to your device's camera and photo gallery. This allows you to capture or select images for:
      <ul>
        <li>Uploading receipts and invoices for reimbursement claims.</li>
        <li>Setting a user profile picture.</li>
      </ul>
      Images are uploaded to our secure servers solely to support these specific app functionalities.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Files and Documents:</strong> The app may request access to your device's storage to upload specific documents (such as PDF invoices or Excel templates for goal planning). These files are collected only when you explicitly choose to upload them.</li>
    <li><strong>Dealer Contact Information:</strong> Users may manually enter dealer phone numbers during visits. These numbers are stored and used solely by the user's organization for operational purposes.</li>
    <li><strong>Device Information (Help Feature):</strong> When a user taps the Help button, their local email client is launched with a pre-filled message containing device model, OS version, and app version. This information is not collected or stored by the app—it is only shared if the user chooses to send the email.</li>
    <li><strong>Device Identifiers:</strong> Firebase services may collect non-personal device identifiers (e.g., Android ID) for crash diagnostics and session tracking. These are used solely for technical analysis and are not linked to user identity.</li>
  </ul>
  <hr>
  <h2>2. Use of Firebase SDKs</h2>
  <p>BizCon uses Firebase SDKs to support authentication, analytics, and crash reporting:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Firebase Authentication:</strong> Used to securely sign in users and manage session state. It may collect basic identifiers such as email addresses or phone numbers, depending on the login method.</li>
    <li><strong>Firebase Analytics:</strong> Collects anonymized usage data to help us understand how users interact with the app. This includes screen views, session duration, and device type. No personally identifiable information (PII) is collected.</li>
    <li><strong>Firebase Crashlytics:</strong> Helps us detect and fix app crashes. It collects crash logs, device model, OS version, and app version at the time of the crash. No sensitive user data is included in crash reports.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>All Firebase services are governed by <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google’s Privacy Policy</a> and comply with industry-standard security practices.</p>
  <hr>
  <h2>3. How We Use Data</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Submitted data (including visits, photos, and documents) is stored securely and used exclusively by the user's organization for internal tracking, reimbursement processing, and workflow optimization.</li>
    <li>No data is shared with third parties.</li>
    <li>We do not use advertising, profiling, or background data collection mechanisms.</li>
  </ul>
  <hr>
  <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>All data transmitted is encrypted in transit using industry-standard protocols (HTTPS).</li>
    <li>Data is stored securely and accessed only by authorized personnel within the user's organization and by MomentumSoft Admin team for debugging purposes only.</li>
  </ul>
  <hr>
  <h2>5. User Rights</h2>
  <p>Users may request deletion of submitted data directly with their organization.</p>
  <hr>
  <h2>6. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>This policy may be updated to reflect changes in app functionality or regulatory requirements. Users will be notified of significant updates via the app or our website.</p>
  <hr>
  <h2>7. Contact Us</h2>
  <p>📧 <strong>support@momentumsoft.in</strong></p>
  <hr>
  <h2>8. User Consent</h2>
  <p>Users are presented with a consent dialog upon first launch to opt in or out of analytics and crash reporting. These services only collect data if the user grants permission. Preferences can be updated via the app settings. Explicit permission is requested from the Android system before accessing Camera or Storage functionality.</p>
  <hr>
  <h2>9. Data Retention</h2>
  <p>Visit data, photos, and uploaded documents are retained for operational use by the user's organization. Users may request deletion through their organization. Crash logs and analytics data are retained by Firebase per their default retention policy.</p>
  <hr>
  <h2>10. Changelog</h2>
