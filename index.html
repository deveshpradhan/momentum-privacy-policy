  <h1>Privacy Policy for BizCon</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> October 15, 2025</p>
  <p><strong>Version:</strong> 1.1</p>

  <p>BizCon ("the App") is developed and maintained by MomentumSoft ("the Company"). We are committed to protecting user privacy and ensuring transparency in how data is handled. This policy outlines the types of information collected, the purpose of collection, and the safeguards in place.</p>

  <hr>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Location Data:</strong> When a user submits a visit form, their current location is sent to our backend and stored for organizational tracking purposes.</li>
    <li><strong>Dealer Contact Information:</strong> Users may manually enter dealer phone numbers during visits. These numbers are stored and used solely by the user's organization for operational purposes.</li>
    <li><strong>Device Information (Help Feature):</strong> When a user taps the Help button, their local email client is launched with a pre-filled message containing device model, OS version, and app version. This information is not collected or stored by the appâ€”it is only shared if the user chooses to send the email.</li>
  </ul>

  <hr>

  <h2>2. Use of Firebase SDKs</h2>
  <p>BizCon uses Firebase SDKs to support authentication, analytics, and crash reporting:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Firebase Authentication:</strong> Used to securely sign in users and manage session state. It may collect basic identifiers such as email addresses or phone numbers, depending on the login method.</li>
    <li><strong>Firebase Analytics:</strong> Collects anonymized usage data to help us understand how users interact with the app. This includes screen views, session duration, and device type. No personally identifiable information (PII) is collected.</li>
    <li><strong>Firebase Crashlytics:</strong> Helps us detect and fix app crashes. It collects crash logs, device model, OS version, and app version at the time of the crash. No sensitive user data is included in crash reports.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>All Firebase services are governed by <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Googleâ€™s Privacy Policy</a> and comply with industry-standard security practices.</p>

  <hr>

  <h2>3. How We Use Data</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Submitted data is stored securely and used exclusively by the user's organization for internal tracking and workflow optimization.</li>
    <li>No data is shared with third parties.</li>
    <li>We do not use advertising, profiling, or background data collection mechanisms.</li>
  </ul>

  <hr>

  <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>All data transmitted is encrypted in transit using industry-standard protocols.</li>
    <li>Data is stored securely and accessed only by authorized personnel within the user's organization and by MomentumSoft Admin team for debugging purposes only.</li>
  </ul>

  <hr>

  <h2>5. User Rights</h2>
  <p>Users may request deletion of submitted data directly with their organization.</p>

  <hr>

  <h2>6. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>This policy may be updated to reflect changes in app functionality or regulatory requirements. Users will be notified of significant updates via the app or our website.</p>
